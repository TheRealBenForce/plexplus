# plexplus
Cloudformation for running plex on AWS

Experiment with running Plex in AWS Cloud. 

I'll merge to master when I'm happy with the progress. For now check out the dev branch.

## TODO
- Create local storage on EFS for mounting between autoscaling
- Create ALB
- Add certificate to ALB
- Add s3fs for media storage
